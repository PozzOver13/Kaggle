# QUORA

## STEP 0> Initialization:
- Github: https://github.com/PozzOver13/Kaggle
- Whatsapp: "Cebi goes to Kaggle"

## STEP 1> Pre-processing of data:
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization (including "ain't" == "isn't")
- Speech Tagging
- Misspelled words removal / count

## STEP 2> Modeling:
- Naive Bayes classifier
- LSTM network with word embedding(s)
- Pattern detection (of speech tags)
- (Hardcore) LTSM network at single characters level (= "do trollers use more capitalized letters or punctuation marks?")
